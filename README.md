## Adafruit GFX Font Converter
**Command Line Tool**

This is a handy utility that goes well with the original [fontconvert](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/tree/master/fontconvert) tool provided by [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) for converting Adafruit_GFX `.h` to Adafruit_GFX `.hpprgm` format.

> [!NOTE]
pplfont is a cutdown version of the [piXfont](https://github.com/Insoft-UK/piXfont) tool. While both can perform the same core font-related task in generating an .hpprgm file, **piXfont** offers additional features, including creating fonts from images, converting .hpprgm files back into .h files, and generating texture atlases.
